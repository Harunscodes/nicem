# NiceM — Open Questions

This document tracks what is not yet known, not yet proven, and not yet decided. It is a living document. Questions should be moved to resolved when answered with evidence or closed when determined to be out of scope.

## Research questions

### On token-tax

- **Q1:** What is the token-tax multiplier for the languages/scripts most relevant to NiceM's target context? (i.e., how many more tokens does an equivalent sentence require in each language compared to English?)
  - *Partially addressed by: Petrov et al., Ahia et al. — TODO: extract specific figures*

- **Q2:** Does token-tax vary across different model providers' tokenizers, or is it consistent across the field?
  - *Status: Open*

- **Q3:** Has token-tax improved over time as newer tokenizers have been released? Is the trend improving or stable?
  - *Status: Open*

### On execution-tax (NiceM hypothesis)

- **Q4:** Can execution-tax be measured empirically? What is the methodology?
  - *Status: Open — core hypothesis validation question*

- **Q5:** What share of total tokens in a typical agentic workflow are overhead (orchestration, scaffolding, repeated context) vs. task content?
  - *Status: Open — requires measurement*

- **Q6:** Does execution-tax vary significantly by workload architecture (e.g., single-agent vs. multi-agent, tool-heavy vs. reasoning-heavy)?
  - *Status: Open*

- **Q7:** Is execution-tax reducible without degrading task quality? What architectural changes reduce it?
  - *Status: Open — requires experimentation*

- **Q8:** Do token-tax and execution-tax compound in real workloads? By how much?
  - *Status: Open*

### On industry context

- **Q9:** Is tokens-per-watt used as an internal efficiency metric by AI infrastructure operators, or is it primarily a public-facing narrative?
  - *Status: Open — affects how NiceM frames its relevance to operators*

- **Q10:** Are there existing tools or benchmarks that measure execution overhead in agentic pipelines?
  - *Status: Open — important for situating NiceM's contribution*

---

## Definitional questions

- **Q11:** Is NiceM's definition of execution-tax consistent with any existing concept in the literature (e.g., inference overhead, KV cache cost, prompt engineering waste)?
  - *Status: Open — literature review needed*

- **Q12:** Should token-tax in NiceM's framing be restricted to language/script disparity, or expanded to include input modality (code vs. prose, structured vs. unstructured)?
  - *Status: Open — scoping decision*

---

## Strategic questions

- **Q13:** Who is the primary audience for NiceM — AI infrastructure operators, end users, policymakers, or model developers?
  - *Status: Open — affects thesis framing and product direction*

- **Q14:** Is NiceM's contribution primarily a measurement framework, a cost attribution tool, an architectural recommendation, or something else?
  - *Status: Open*

## Resolved questions

*(Move questions here when answered, with a brief note on the resolution and the source.)*

| Question | Resolution | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Does token-tax exist? | Yes — established in literature | Petrov et al., Ahia et al., Lundin |
| Is token-tax an API cost problem, not just a tokenization problem? | Yes — pricing is per-token | Ahia et al. |
| Is agentic infrastructure a real and growing industry direction? | Yes — confirmed by NVIDIA and Jensen Huang | Industry sources |
